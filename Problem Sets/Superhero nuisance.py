# That freaking superhero has been frequenting Udacity
# as his favorite boss battle fight stage. The 'Udacity'
# banner keeps breaking, and money is being wasted on
# repairs. This time, we need you to proceduralize the
# fixing process by building a machine to automatically
# search through debris and return the 'Udacity' banner
# to the company, and be able to similarly fix other goods.

# Write a Python procedure fix_machine to take 2 string inputs
# and returns the 2nd input string as the output if all of its
# characters can be found in the 1st input string and "Give me
# something that's not useless next time." if it's impossible.

# NOTE: # If you are experiencing difficulties taking
        # this problem seriously, please refer back to
        # "Superhero flyby", the prequel, in Problem Set 11.

# TOOLS: # if statement
         # while loop

def fix_machine(debris, product):
    l = len(product)
    i=1
    l=l-1
    while(l>=0):
        if(debris.find(product[i-1:i])==-1):
           return "Give me something that's not useless next time."
        i=i+1
        l= l-1
    return product 
### TEST CASES ###
print "Test case 1: ", fix_machine('UdaciousUdacitee', 'Udacity') == "Give me something that's not useless next time."
print "Test case 2: ", fix_machine('buy me dat Unicorn', 'Udacity') == 'Udacity'
print "Test case 3: ", fix_machine('AEIOU and sometimes y... c', 'Udacity') == 'Udacity'
print "Test case 4: ", fix_machine('wsx0-=mttrhix', 't-shirt') == 't-shirt'

### Solving with different approach:

def fix_machine(debris, product):
    i = 0
    while i < len(product):
        if debris.find(product[i]) != -1:
            i += 1
        else:
            return "Give me something that's not useless next time."
    return product
